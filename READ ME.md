1. Project overview / Background.
SyriaTel prides itself in provision of a wide range of services, including mobile, landline, and internet connectivity, to its customers. However, the company faces the menace of customer churn which is a problem that is witnessed across several other telecommunication companies.

The communication technology industry is one of the most competitive industries nowadays. The main problem that practically all telecommunications industries worldwide are currently facing is customer churn.Churn, in the context of telecommunications, is the process by which customers leave a business and stop using the services it provides either because they are unhappy with those services or because they can find better options from other network providers at more reasonable prices. This could result in a loss of revenue or profit for the business. Additionally, keeping clients has grown to be a challenging task.

In order to provide their clients with the best services possible and keep them satisfied, businesses are working hard to introduce new cutting-edge applications and technology.Since losing them would result in a large loss of revenue for the business, it is imperative to identify those clients who are likely to quit the organization in the near future in advance. Accurately predicing churn can lead to higher customer retention rates, increased market share and improved business performance.This project seeks to accomplish this procedure, which is known as churn prediction. We tried to detect whether there is a noticeable pattern for this, study the customer behavior and key factors that influences churn. We utilized data and machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent churn.

2. Stakeholders.
Stakeholders for this project are the Customer Retention Team and Potential Investors and Partners.

3. Problem statement.
Business is becoming extremely saturated in this competitive world. SyriaTel telecommunications company wants to take the required actions to retain customers in order to stabilize their market value because the cost of recruiting new customers is significantly higher than the cost of maintaining existing customers and also in order to reduce losses incurred from customer churn.


4. Objectives.
- Main objective:
To predict customer churn using a machine learning classification algorithm model

- Specific objectives:
To do exploratory data analysis on the data
To fit different classification algorithm models to determine which one works best for churn prediction
To select the best model
To make predictions using the selected model
To check the accuracy of the predicted variables

5. Business Understanding.
SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is experiencing severe churn, with many consumers abandoning its services and migrating to competitors. The company intends to address this issue by creating a churn prediction model. SyriaTel hopes to obtain insights into churn-related factors through analyzing the dataset, with the goal of lowering churn, increasing customer retention, and enhancing overall profitability.

6. Data understanding.
This data is from syriatel telecommunication company and it was obtained from kaggle Churn in Telecom's dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset .
The data has 21 columns and 3333 rows. The target column, churn, is a bool column where True means the customer did churn and False means the customer did not churn, making this a binary classification problem. The other columns were; 6 categorical and 15 numerical columns.
